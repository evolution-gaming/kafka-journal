/** Prevents overload of the expensive resources.
  *
  * The idea is that a single damper is set up to protect a resource, which
  * could be overwhelmed, i.e. a [[KafkaConsumer]].
  *
  * Then, before using a resource, [[#acquire]] is called, and, when resource is
  * not needed anymore, [[#release]] is called instead.
  *
  * The trivial implementation would be the following:
  * {{{
  * class TrivialDamper[F[_]: Temporal](duration: FiniteDuration) extends Damper[F] {
  *   def acquire: F[Unit] = Temporal[F].sleep(duration)
  *   def release: F[Unit] = ().pure[F]
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * In this case all the calls to a resource will get artificially delayed by
  * `duration`.
  *
  * The more complicated implementation may only delay the [[#acquire]] call if
  * sufficient number of calls accumulated, i.e. if there are `< N` ongoing
  * calls then [[#acquire]] returns immediately, or sleeps for some time,
  * otherwise.
  * 
  * The recommended way to use the instances of [[Damper]] is to call
  * [[Damper.DamperOps#resource]] to ensure the [[#release]] calls are not forgotten.
  * The explicit calls of [[#acquire]] and [[#release]] are reserved for the
  * cases where more control is required.
