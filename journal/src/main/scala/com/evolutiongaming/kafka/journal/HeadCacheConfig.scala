  *   Duration to wait until [[HeadInfo]] appears in cache from either Kafka
  *   consumer or Cassandra poller before returning `None` in [[HeadCache#get]].
  *   See [[PartitionCache#of]] and [[PartitionCache.Result.Now.Timeout]] for
  *   more details on internals.
  * @param expiry
  *   Duration to keep [[TopicCache]] alive after a last read. Having such an
  *   expiration period decreases the load on the underlying databases for
  *   topics, which do not require to do recoveries lately.
  * @param removeInterval
  *   How often Cassandra is being polled for the information about already
  *   replicated records.
  * @param partition
  *   Partition cache configuration as described in [[HeadCacheConfig.Partition]].
