# Main goals:
# - nicer commit diffs (trailing commas, no alignment for pattern matching, force new lines)
# - better interop with default IntelliJ IDEA setup (matching import and modifiers sorting logic)
# - better developer experience on laptop screens (like 16' MBPs) with IntelliJ IDEA (line wraps)
